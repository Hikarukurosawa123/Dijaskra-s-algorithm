Continous Bladder Irrigation is a surgical procedure involving the flushing of the bladder with sterile liquid to prevent blood clotting after surgery in the urinary system. 
The current medical system primarily relies on a passive gravity-fed mechanism that has the nurses to monitor and swich the irrigation bags when emptied. 
However, this manual labor process imposes high burden and inconvenience onto the nurses as it requires physical labor and excessive time to manage the system.
Here, a development of a semi-automated irrigation device is proposed to be able to automatically switch irrigation bags and monitor the blood concentration inside the urine to adjust the inflow rate of the sterile liquid accordingly (greater blood concentration indicates a necessity of higher inflow rate).
This is done in collaboration with the St. Michael's hospital, and the next steps include validation of this irrigation system thorough physical testing.
