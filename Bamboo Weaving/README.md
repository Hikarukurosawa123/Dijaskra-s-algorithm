This work was done as part of a design course aimed to develop a design to address an opportunity found inside a community. 

We have decided to work with the bamboo weavers in rural Thailand given their problem of declining bamboo market. 

Among many problems such as the molding of bamboo, back pain during weaving, health hazards during bamboo processing, we scoped down to address the low profitability of the bamboo products due to the low demand of hand-woven items. 

Our research indicated that an incorporation of an additional complexity to a design can elevate the market value by 100% (e.g. having multiple weaving patterns), we aimed to facilitate the educational process of the weavers to be able to weave more intricate designs.
