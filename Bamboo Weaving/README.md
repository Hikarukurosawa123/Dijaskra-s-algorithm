This work was done as part of a design course aimed to develop a design to address an opportunity found inside a community. 

We have decided to work with the bamboo weavers in rural Thailand given their problem of declining bamboo market. 

Among many problems such as the molding of bamboo, back pain during weaving, health hazards during bamboo processing, we scoped down to address the low profitability of the bamboo products due to the low demand of hand-woven items. 

Our research indicated that an incorporation of an additional complexity to a design can elevate the market value by 100% (e.g. having multiple weaving patterns), we aimed to facilitate the educational process of the weavers to be able to weave more intricate designs. 

Our final prototype consisted of two parts. 
1) an LED at the top compartment that corresponds to the location of individual bamboo strips with a color sensor to assess the user's accuracy of the weaving 
2) A "feeding mechanism" that feeds the bamboo strips forward once the correct pattern was woven at the row right below the LED.

For instance, if the LED was lit up in the order of (ON, OFF, ON, OFF, ON), there will be strips at location 1, 3, and 5. A different colored LED would light up at location 2 and 4 (OFF, ON, OFF, ON, OFF) for two strips to be inserted horizontally, making a layered structure. A representation of the model is shown below.
