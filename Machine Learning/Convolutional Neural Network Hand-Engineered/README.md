This code implements a hand-engineered fully connected neural network. 
A hand-written digit dataset of numbers between 0~9 from the MNIST library was used. 
A training and testing accuracy of approximately 85% was achieved with a neural network layer dimension of (784, 200, 80, 10).

Some samples images of the training datasets are the following:

A plot of the cost vs iteration curve - consistent cost decline was observed.
