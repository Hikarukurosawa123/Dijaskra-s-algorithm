Using the model created by the mechanical team, a thermal simulation of the satellite model orbiting the space environment was computed. Based on this estimate of the satellite's expected temperature profile, the properties of various heat controllers such as thermal strap tapes, Thermal Electric Coolers, and heaters were determined.
