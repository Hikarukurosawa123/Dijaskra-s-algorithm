This folder contains work from a design course in which we have collaborated with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to develop an improved gondola carrier design for Stratospheric Balloons. 

The initial opportunity was formulated when our team noticed the insufficient gondola (external structure that houses the cargo) and developed a design proposal to make a more protective gondola design.

We have gone thorough the engineering design frame work (framing, diverging, converging, representing) and decided to prototype a user-centric design that alleviates the user's burden of cargo installation. 

The work is summarized below:

More information about the opportunity can be found in the Request for Proposal (RFP) document.
