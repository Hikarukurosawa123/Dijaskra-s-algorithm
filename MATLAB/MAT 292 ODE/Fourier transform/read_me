This code investigates the use of fourier transform to identify the frequencies in which the superposed function is made out of. 
For instance, if a function is composed out of a sum of sine waves with frequencies, 10, 20, 30, 100, and 200, in the frequency domain (after the fouier transform is applied), 
there would be spikes at 10, 20, 30, 100, and 200. This is useful in the context of sound processing; if there are undesirable "noises" in the (say, a high pitch sound), that specific sound
can be eliminated by equating the value at the high frequency in the fourier domain as zero, and apply the inverse fourier transform to obtain the sound file without the high frequency.
